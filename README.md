## Intuitive record application focused on backend functionality

### Description
In general, applications using CRUD features may lack a functional and intuitive UI. CRUD-Buster aims to solve both of these problems through use of the PHP language and testing.

### Tests
Testing the DB ensures it functions propery when the app is implemented. Results are exported into the /sql-test folder
